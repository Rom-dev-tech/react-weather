### About application
Write SPA to display the weather in the specified city. Find and use any open API to get data.
The application should have two pages:
- Home page, showing the current weather
in the city of Minsk (by default). There should be 4 buttons on the page, with
with the help of which the cities are switched (Minsk, Moscow, Bratislava, Kiev)
with the subsequent updating of the page. The selected city must remain
saved so that it remains selected after reloading the page.
- Side page displaying hourly and 5 days
weather forecast for the specified city. On initialization, the page takes the city
from the URL (the path could be, for example, {...} / in / Milan). Also on the page
there should be a text field, filling in which you can change the city.
